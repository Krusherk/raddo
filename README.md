> 25 tiles. 2 are lethal. Last one standing wins the pot.

## What is TAKKO?

TAKKO is a 1v1 on-chain game built on [Monad](https://monad.xyz). Two players take turns clicking tiles on a 5×5 grid. Two tiles are secretly marked as "danger tiles" using Pyth Entropy VRF. Hit one, and you lose. Survive, and you win double your bet.

## How It Works

1. **Login** — Sign in with email. A wallet is auto-created for you.
2. **Choose Stakes** — Pick a tier: 1, 5, or 10 MON.
3. **Get Matched** — Wait for an opponent or join an open game.
4. **Take Turns** — Click tiles. Safe tiles show X or O.
5. **Win** — Last player standing takes 2× the bet.
